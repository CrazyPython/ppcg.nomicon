# Rules
## Immutable rules
1. No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.
2. If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and vote.
3. The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving n points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.
4. Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

## Mutable rules

## Metarules
1. Rules with lower numbering will prevail.
2. Applicable rule changes are
  - the addition of a new mutable rule 
  - an amendment to a mutable rule 
  - the repeal of a mutable rule 
  - the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable 
  - or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable
3. Rule priority goes as follows:
   metarule --> immutable rule --> mutable rule
4. Transmuting an immutable rule to a mutable one requires a supermajority of 60% and will be held over a period of one and a half weeks.
5. Transmuting an metarule to a mutable one requires a supermajority of 70% and will be held over a period of two weeks.
6. The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.
