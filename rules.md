# Rules
## Immutable rules
1. No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.
2. If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and vote.
3. The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving n points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.
4. Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.
5. Rules starting with `~` are guidelines and noticies. They may freely use vague language and are not enforceable. 
6. Voting/rule change details
 - A proposed rule change is proposed as a Pull Request to rules.md
 - An affirmative vote is cast using the "thumbs up" emoji reaction
 - A negative vote is cast using the "thumbs down" emoji reaction
 - A rule-change is accepted (*merged*) if there are more thumbs up than thumbs down after one week of rule proposal.
 - A rule-change that does not meet the above requirements is closed to prevent clutter
 - A previously denied rule change may be proposed again
7. Bureaucrats
 - Bureaucrats are trusted players who perform maintenance tasks. A maintenance task is defined as:
   - Merging Pull Requests that meet the requirements for rule creation
 - ~ Bureaucrats are a position created to keep the game moving even when one or more of the owners is away.
8. ~ Rule-proposal Formatting
 - Add `[WIP]` to the title of your rule proposal if it is not ready for voting, for example if you want others to review it first.
 - When it is ready to be voted on, 
   - Embed a diff in your rule proposal in the following format. On PRs, it will render in color: 
        ```
        + this is an added line
        - this is a removed line
        this is a normal line
        ```
   - Add an end date for voting, seven days after the day when voting started.


## Mutable rules

## Metarules
1. Rules with lower numbering will prevail.
2. Applicable rule changes are
  - the addition of a new mutable rule 
  - an amendment to a mutable rule 
  - the repeal of a mutable rule 
  - the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable 
  - or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable
3. Rule priority goes as follows:
   metarule --> immutable rule --> mutable rule
4. Transmuting an immutable rule to a mutable one requires a supermajority of 60% and will be held over a period of one and a half weeks.
5. Transmuting an metarule to a mutable one requires a supermajority of 70% and will be held over a period of two weeks.
6. The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.
